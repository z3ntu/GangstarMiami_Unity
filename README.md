This Unity project displays some models (and some more stuff) from the game "Gangstar: Miami Vindication" for Android & iOS and was mostly used as a playing ground for procedural generation of a model from an existing file.

To do anything you have to change the paths in `Assets/Scripts/GameController.cs` to 1. the "game cache" (data you have to put into `/sdcard/gameloft/games/Gangstar2` normally) and 2. the normal game apk. You will find both with Google (as it isn't even available for purchase anymore, so you can't obtain the content "legally") ;)

There is some more information about what I have done in my [gist](https://gist.github.com/z3ntu/93d05b38d9ba10811c3f1f2d0ae214a6) and the [Xentax forum, starting at that post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=119302#p119302).
This repo contains some plugins in `Assets/Plugins/` which are under some license (apparently 'Ms-PL').
